Sheela MS has been working as a software professional for the past 20 years. She has acquired a wide range of experience in development, maintenance and testing of IT systems. 

Sheela started her career as a Mainframe - COBOL developer and has worked with well known clients such as DHL, Allstate Insurance, Volvo, Macy's, J.F Fabrics - to name a few. She has been eager to learn new tools and technologies and does not let go of any opportunity to take up new challenges.

After having worked as a developer and QA analyst, Sheela is keen to explore the world of technical writing as she has always been interested in writing. Coming from a development background, she has the ability to read and understand code written in any language and that could be an advantage to understand different API's and document them.
