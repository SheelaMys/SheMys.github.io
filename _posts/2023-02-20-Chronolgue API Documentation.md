The Chronologue is a fictional telescope that can look into the past, and make predictions for the future, too. Users can watch pre-rendered events on a website, or submit requests for new events to be recorded. (The Chronologue project is a working group within the Good Docs project.
The primary task of the group is to create example documentation to increase the understanding of what good documentation can look like.)


To create credible examples, the group decided to build a fictional product - the Chronologue. The Chronologue is a time-travel telescope that records astronomical events of the future, and past.
The Chronologue consists of:

A time-travel telescope (fictional)
An API to transmit data between the telescope and the website
A website to view events recorded by the telescope

What weâ€™ve already done so far:

 - Prototyping user journeys and wireframes
 - Specifying an API to retrieve data

I am part of the volunteer group at the Chronologue project and contributed in documenting the API endpoint 3. A snapshot of the work is here:

I have also updated the Overview section of the API reference document. 
A sneek peak to the work is here:
