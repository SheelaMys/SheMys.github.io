## We all need a break

 Life is pretty mundane. We follow the same routine day after day until we realise we have spent a considerable chunk of our lives doing the same things. And then one fine day we find ourselves not happy with what we are doing. We crave for change. We suddenly start questioning if this is what we set out to do since the start. It is quite normal to hit a saturation point in life in anything we do. It could be work, our favorite food, a favorite sport, a close to heart destination, the dear friend we had. 

 We should accept and acknowledge our feelings and take a break from anything that no longer excites/interests us.

## We can dream to be different

It is never too late to start developing a new hobby, a new skill, meet new people, form new opinions, build new experiences. What matters is, have we given enough time to introspect and are we ready to give our 100% in what we are setting out to. Are we ready to indulge ourselves in the new venture that is inviting us to take the plunge? If the answer is a resounding YES, we can conquer it all.

### And be successful!

Once we zero in on what makes us happy at that point in life, we start working towards it.
I have spent considerable amount of my time as a developer and when I hit a saturation point, I took the tough decision of taking a break, going on a vacation, coming back and pondering over what I would like to do. Writing interests me and sparks joy in me. Being a technical person, I thought how about combining my technical expertise and writing, which is when I started my journey in the field of technical writing. I am putting in my effort to equip myself with the best tools and technologies to become a successful API technical writer. I am looking for that opportunity where I can put to use all that I have learnt and be what I aspire to be.
